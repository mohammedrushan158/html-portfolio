<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a strong foundation in computer science and a growing passion for software development. I have hands-on knowledge of multiple programming and web technologies, including HTML, CSS, Java, and Python, and I enjoy applying these skills to build practical and efficient solutions. I am detail-oriented, eager to learn, and committed to continuously improving my technical expertise.</p>

<p>Currently, I am training as a full stack developer, where I am expanding my skills across both front-end and back-end development. This training has strengthened my understanding of how complete web applications are designed, developed, and maintained. I am motivated to grow in a professional environment where I can contribute my skills, learn from real-world projects, and evolve into a well-rounded software professional.</p>
